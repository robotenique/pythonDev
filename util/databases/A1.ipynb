I'll get the good cases by checking if, for two FlightInstances F1 and F2, F1.arrivalTime < F2.departureTime, then they DON'T OVERLAP, since all flights starts and ends in the same day only. This will eliminate the (pseudo)duplicates + overlapping flights, and we then filter only the IDs of the flight + eID. This will gives us a tuple with (fA, fB, eID). Then, to get the flights that DO overlap, first we need to remove the (pseudo) duplicates from the table, filter them the same way, and subtract all good flights from all flights, which will get us the flights that DO overlap.\n",
