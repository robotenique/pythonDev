## Anaconda environment
This work uses the [Anaconda tool](https://www.anaconda.com), especially, it uses the `conda` tool for managing the environment configuration. You can install the current environment with:

```bash 
$ conda env create --file=env.yaml
```

And if any change is made, you can save it again with:

```bash 
$ conda env export > env.yaml
```
